# EditorConfig Resources

### editorconfig.props

Contains the props that has to be included to package. It has to be equally named as the package, because:

> A NuGet package can include a MSBuild `.props` file of the same name that can contain Properties, Package References and Targets that execute when a build is performed and are applied to the project that references the NuGet package.

_For example `To.Be.Created.Package.props`._

### editorconfig.base

Represents the base rules for `.editorconfig`-file.
